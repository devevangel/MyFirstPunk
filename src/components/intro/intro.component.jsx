      MyFirstPunks is the first project by baby-artist Infant.Anon
      <br />
      <br />
      Inspired by all the haters who say “my kid could draw that” about our
      favourite collectibles. MyFirstPunks are a 1:1 depiction of all 10,000
      CryptoPunks, reimagined by the hand of a 7-month-old.
      <br />
      <br />
      Absurd? Top signal? Super cute collectible? Whatever you think,
      MyFirstPunks will hold a place in history as the first baby-generated-NFT
      project.
      <br />
      <br />
      20% of all sale proceeds will be donated to Action Against Hunger to
      supply food and clean water to those in need of help.
